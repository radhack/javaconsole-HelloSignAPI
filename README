                Alex's Java Console App
                   HelloSign Test

Purpose:

    I created this app because one of our customers was having an issue with
    authentication on AWS using Java 1.8. With 1.7, he could get his app to 
    perfectly fine, but 1.8 kept failing with some strange authentication
    issues.
    
    After creating this app, uploading it to an AWS instance, and running it
    successfully, I sent him the app so he could see for himself. This app
    helped us show that it wasn't our SDK or the Java version specifically
    that was causing the issue, but rather his certificates.

    Now we can use this app for experimenting with Java and HelloSign's SDK,
    and for testing customer snippets in Java.
